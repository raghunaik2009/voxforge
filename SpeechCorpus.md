A Speech Corpus (or Spoken Corpus) is a database of speech audio files and text transcriptions of these audio files in a format that can be used to create Acoustical Models (which can then be used with a Speech Recognition Engine).  ISIP's Switchboard database is a good example of this.

A corpus is one such database.  Corpora is the plural of corpus (i.e. it is many such databases).

There are two types of Speech Copora:

(1) Read Speech - which includes

  * Book excerpts;
  * Broadcast news;
  * Lists of words;
  * Sequences of numbers.

(2) Spontaneous Speech - which includes:

  * Dialogs - between two or more people (includes meetings);
  * Narratives - a person telling a story;
  * Map-tasks -  one person explains a route on a map to another;
  * Appointment-tasks - two people try to find a common meeting time based on individual schedules.
