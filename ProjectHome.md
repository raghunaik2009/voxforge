[VoxForge](http://www.voxforge.org/) was set up to collect speech audio files to create a  GPL Speech Corpus for use with Free and Open Source Speech Recognition Engines (on Linux and Windows).

The transcribed speech will be 'compiled' into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines such as [Julius](http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php?q=en/index.html), [ISIP](http://www.ece.msstate.edu/research/isip/projects/speech/index.html), and [Sphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/html/cmusphinx.php), and [HTK](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/) (note that HTK has distribution restrictions).

# Why Do We Need Free GPL Speech Audio? #

Most [acoustic models](http://code.google.com/p/voxforge/wiki/AcousticModel) used by 'Open Source' Speech Recognition engines are **closed source**. They do not give you access to the speech audio and transcriptions (the 'source') used to create the acoustic model.

The reason for this is because Open Source projects are required to purchase [speech copora](http://code.google.com/p/voxforge/wiki/SpeechCorpus) which has restrictive licensing (i.e. they are _not_ permitted to distribute the 'source' speech audio, but they are permitted to distribute the 'compiled' acoustic model).  There is **no free** [speech corpus](http://code.google.com/p/voxforge/wiki/SpeechCorpus) in a form that can readily be used to create Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition Engines.

# How Can You Help? #

Record yourself reading some text, and upload your recordings to VoxForge using one of the following methods:
  * [using your computer](http://code.google.com/p/voxforge/wiki/SubmitSpeech) (using a Java applet which provides you with a list of prompts to read, and a "one-click" uploader)
    * Speech Submission Application mirrors:
      * [VoxForge Repository](http://www.read.voxforge1.org/)
      * [VoxForge Home site](http://www.voxforge.org/home/read)
  * [submit an audio book chapter](http://www.voxforge.org/home/uploads) (e.g. if you have an audio book chapter for submission to [LibriVox](http://librivox.org/))

# Where Can You Try It Out Now? #

Acoustic models, created using donated speech, for the [Julius](http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php?q=en/index.html) Speech Recognition Engine:
  * [Linux](http://voxforge.googlecode.com/files/julius-3.5.2-quickstart-windows.zip)
  * [Windows](http://voxforge.googlecode.com/files/julius-3.5.2-quickstart-windows.zip)
  * [Nightly Build](http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/Nightly_Builds/)
