## Before you Begin Recording Prompts ##

Position your microphone so it does not pick up your breathing.  While recording, try to minimize any non-speech noises (i.e. lip smacking, taking a breath, ...) or background noise.  Don't exhale until after you have clicked the Stop button.

The black box near the bottom of your screen will display the audio waveform of your recording. Please [record a test recording](http://code.google.com/p/voxforge/wiki/RecordingHowto) to ensure your microphone volume is not too high or too low.

## Recording Prompts ##

For each prompt line, please record your speech as follows:

  1. click the Record button,
  1. pause for half a second,
  1. read the corresponding prompt sentence,
  1. pause for half a second, and then
  1. click the the Stop button.

If you make a mistake, click Record again to re-record your prompt.

Once you have completed recording all ten prompts the Upload button will activate. Click the Upload button to upload your entire submission to the VoxForge repository as a single zip file.

Repeat the process (multiple are submissions encouraged!)
